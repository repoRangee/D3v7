# @essex/powerbi-visual-scripts

This package contains scripts for building PowerBI visuals using the Essex PowerBI build system.
This build system is designed to emulate the high-level features of the PowerBI-visuals-tools, including the developer visual and bundling capabilities, but using webpack and more normative Typescript idioms (e.g. excluding namespaces, allowing imports).
